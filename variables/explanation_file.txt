Step 5:
- we create a folder called "variables"; with which we are a way of setting a value that we can use multiple times in too many different files.

- so do to so, inside that "variables" folder, we should create a .tf file called "main"
- and there we declare our variables


Step 6:
- how we declare variables

Step 7:
- how to use variables

Step 8:
- how to use Input variables
