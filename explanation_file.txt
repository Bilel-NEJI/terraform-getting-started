Step 1 --> Step 4:
- in the folder "first-resource"

Step 5:
- we create a folder called "variables"; with which we are a way of setting a value that we can use multiple times in too many different files.
- so instead of going back to change all those files, it's better to do it this way
- so do to so, inside that "variables" folder, we should create a .tf file called "main"
- and there we declare our variables


Step 6:
- how we declare variables

Step 7:
- how to use variables

Step 8:
- how to use Input variables

Step 9:
- how to use Output and Attributes at the same time
- we will continue in the variables/main.tf file

Step 10:
- how to use dynamic blocks
- dynamic blocks are a way you can create reusable portions of code and do so dynamically
- we are going to use the file "main.tf" inside the folder "dynamic"

Step 11:
- how to use tuples and objects

Step 12:
- how to work with dependencies
- for this we need an AMI id before we start because we are going to be spinning up en EC2 isntance
- each AMI will be different per region

Step 13:
- hwo to work with datasources
- datasources are a way terraform can query AWS and return a result
- essentially what datasources do; is you make an API request to get information, so they don't set anything up
